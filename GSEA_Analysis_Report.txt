Files Generated:
- key_pathways_across_severities.csv
- immune_inflammatory_pathways.csv
- pathway_progression_analysis.csv
- specific_pathway_category_files.csv
- Various visualization plots (.png files)

Key Findings:
1. Review the immune_pathways_heatmap.png to see immune response patterns
2. Check pathway_progression_plot.png to understand disease progression
3. Examine covid_pathway_categories.png for COVID-specific pathway analysis
4. Use key_pathways_barplot.png to identify consistently altered pathways

Recommendations:
1. Focus on pathways with |NES| > 1.5 and p.adjust < 0.05
2. Prioritize immune and inflammatory pathways for further validation
3. Consider pathways that show consistent direction across severities
4. Investigate pathways unique to severe/critical COVID cases
